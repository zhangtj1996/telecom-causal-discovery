# telecom-causal-discovery
A real dataset for causal discovery from the ICASSP-SPGC 2022 Root Cause Analysis for Wireless Network Fault Localization.

We extract the bivariate causal relationships from the competition data to form the datasets for bivariate causal discovery.

This code repo includes 
- the code to extract bivariate data pairs.
- some baseline methods.

# Usage
Please first download the data from the competition website https://www.aiops.sribd.cn/home/introduction
